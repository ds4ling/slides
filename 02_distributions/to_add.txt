Measurement

- Measurement is the processes of assigning a number to an 
observation:
  - Every observation must be turned into a number before 
  statistical analysis can take place
- Pacifica’s critique of Educational Psychology: 
  - Multiple regression demands that everything about your 
  child be converted into a number! 
- Where do we get these numbers?
  - Empirical observations and the process of measurement

---

Rules of Measurement

- These numbers are not arbitrary, but are assigned 
based upon certain rules

- Measurement is a meaningful and selective process:
  - The numbers must possess certain predefined 
  characteristics

- The measurements must be Reliable: 
  - Inter-Rater, Inter-Item, Test-Retest, etc. 
  - Must be replicable

- The measurements must be Valid:
  - The numbers must measure what we say they do 
  - Bathroom scale as self-serving IQ test

- Not all numbers are scientific data:
  - In order to be scientific the numbers must be reliable and valid measurements based on empirical observations

Observation

- Definition: Using the senses for some motivated purpose

- Senses are not always reliable and do not necessarily 
perfectly represent reality:
  - Sensory observations are already a step removed from 
  reality because they are first passed through our 
  perceptions and reinterpreted before we actually 
  “make sense” of them
  - In other words, our raw sensory input is not what we 
  perceive

---

Observation

- We have many evolved adaptive mechanisms for deciphering 
sensory input:
  - First, we have a sensation
  - Then, perception reconstructs it into a meaningful 
  message in our brain
  - We then use measurement to turn this processed 
  information into numbers
  - We then use statistics to analyze our numbers
- Clearly, there is a lot of room for bias and error in 
this multi-stage process!

Numbers

- Do “the numbers speak for themselves”? 
  - NO!

- Our brain’s process the number and then we speak 
for them
  - We interpret the numbers in certain way based what we 
  think they represent

- All our interpretations are subject to errors 
  - This is called fallibility
  – There are lots of opportunities to make errors in the 
  process

- So how do we know that our numbers aren’t too far 
removed from reality?
