The vocabulary data were analyzed using a general linear model. Estimated 
vocabulary size was the criterion with *age* and *reader type* 
(frequent/average) as predictors. The *reader type* factor was dummy coded with 
average readers set as the reference group. Main effects and the *age* by 
*reader type* interaction were assessed using nested model comparisons. 
Experiment-wise alpha was set at 0.05. 

There was a main effect of age (F(1) = 1649.49, p < 0.001), reader type 
(F(1) = 243.34; p < 0.001), as well as an age by reader type interaction 
(F(1) = 45.19; p < 0.001). The model containing the interaction provided the 
best fit of the data (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91). Overall, vocabulary size increased 
as a function of age. However, the size of the effect was modulated by reader 
type. Specifically, average readers showed an increase of approximately 1,111 
words +/- 48.42 se (t = 22.94, p < 0.001) per year. Frequent readers showed an 
additional increase of 466 words +/- 69.28 se per year 
(1,577 words total, t = 6.72, p < 0.001).
