### Multiple Causation

::: {.closelist}
- In nature: a phenomenon may have more than a single cause
- In statistics: criterion variable might have more than a single relevant predictor

::: {.fragment}
- Leaving a potential cause out of the equation would constitute "omitting 
a relevant variable"
  - This biases the parameter estimates for the other predictors
  - We are not always sure of what those other predictors might be!

### Overview

::: {.closelist}
- We have specified a linear formula that can account for the relationship between two continuous variables. 

::: box-note
$$Y = a + bX + e$$
:::

- It is uncommon for a given response variable to be determined by a single predictor
- Most theories/models in social science predict complex relationships 
between multiple predictors.
  - Score ~ SES + IQ
  - Duration ~ speech rate + number of syllables
  - RT ~ working memory + word position
- We can extend the linear model equation to account for multiple predictors.

- We want to construct the equivalent of an [**OR**]{.emph} statement or a *logical disjunction* 
- Boolean Algebra tells us that an [**OR**]{.emph} statement implies *summing things*
- In other words, all X's do not have to be high at once to have an effect on Y
- For example, you can get an overall high GRE score by scoring high in verbal but (somewhat) low in math:
  - They have to have a high total (or sum) 
  - A sum is implicitly an [**OR**]{.emph} statement
